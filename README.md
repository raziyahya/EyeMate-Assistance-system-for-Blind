# EyeMate-Assistance-system-for-Blind
Welcome to the project repository! Our project aims to bridge the gap between the visual and auditory worlds for individuals with visual impairments. By employing advanced image processing and machine learning, the system offers real-time guidance through a camera setup, conveying crucial information about objects, faces, and text via audio prompts. In addition to the "Blind Side" Android application and the caregiver module, this repository houses all relevant code folders. Visually impaired users can issue voice commands for various functionalities, while caregivers can monitor and interact with the system through a web interface. Please refer to the documentation for an in-depth understanding of the project's components, user interactions, and administrative features. To access the comprehensive project report and application screenshots, explore the provided documentation.

Project Objective:
The core aim of this project is to transform the visual realm into an auditory experience, offering crucial assistance to individuals with visual impairments. This is achieved by utilizing sophisticated image processing and machine learning techniques to provide real-time guidance through a camera interface. The system effectively communicates information about objects, human faces, and textual content obstructing the path of visually impaired individuals through audio feedback. Additionally, an integrated module empowers caregivers to monitor real-time location, address potential accidents, and engage in video calls with the visually impaired. The project repository comprises dedicated folders for both the Android application catering to the visually impaired (referred to as the "Blind Side") and the caregiver's interface.

User Interaction and Commands:
Visually impaired users can initiate specific voice commands to interact with the system. These commands include "dial" to initiate a video call with the caregiver, "scan" to detect objects, "capture" to identify individuals in front of them, "read" to have textual characters audibly rendered, and "help" to request assistance in emergencies. The system provides audio responses to these commands, ensuring effective communication.

Caretaker's Role and Functionality:
For caregivers, a dedicated web-based interface allows them to monitor the real-time location of visually impaired individuals, receive video calls, access information about emergency requests, and promptly respond to incidents using a shake-detection mechanism on the user's mobile device. The registration process for visually impaired users is facilitated by caregivers. Additionally, an administrative module is integrated, enabling the addition of caregivers and the assessment of system functionalities.
